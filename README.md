# FoodPlannerBlazorClient
A web client for the [FoodPlanner WebAPI](https://github.com/MadTiger2409/FoodPlanner) written using Blazor Framework (WebAssembly)

## Why
As the Web API part of the project grow up, I decided to start working on the web client for it. As I'm working most of my time with C#, it was obvious to go with Blazor.

The web client will help with the use of the project because the typical person doesn't want to send HTTP requests on their own and interpret responses.
